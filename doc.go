/*
Package logif specifies a logging interface for application logging that supports independently-levelled INFO and DEBUG
messages. This interface is modelled largely after the interface presented by glog, but forgoes the opinionated output
behaviors of that library in favor of flexible (and pluggable) logging libraries.
